There is one assignment for this course.Â To get credit, a student must write a paper that applies some of the ideas discussed in the class and present it. The objective of this assignment is to help the students to start developing research ideas and learn the process of writing a theory paper from modeling to obtaining interesting results. There will be extensive probing and grilling in the presentation, which will hopefully improve the paper.
